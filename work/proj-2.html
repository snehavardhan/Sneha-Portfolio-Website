<p>Soul Horse offers massage and bodywork services for horses. I worked
with the site owner Barbara Glass to identify content that would be included
in her website such as About, Services, option to book an appointment etc.
and ensured that the contact info was readily available on all pages. </p>

<p>Based on the feedback and color palette selections from Barbara Glass, I was able
to create and implement the website including responsive design. WordPress is used as the
content management system for the development of this website.</p>
