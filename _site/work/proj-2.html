<p>I worked with the site owner Barbara Glass to identify the key content that would
need to be included in her website, such as About information, services, booking an
appointment etc. I also ensured that the contact info was readily available on all
pages.</p>

<p>Based on the feedback and color palette selections from Barbara Glass, I
was able to create and implement the website including responsive design for various
 device types. I used Wordpress as the content management system for the website development.</p>
